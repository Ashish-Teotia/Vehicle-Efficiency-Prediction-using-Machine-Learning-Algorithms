# Vehicle-Efficiency-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
The performance analysis and efficiency of a 
vehicle play a prominent role and a very necessary step to do in 
today's scenario. There are various instances when the user 
feels reluctant to discard the vehicle. In such cases where the 
user is ignorant of the fact to discard the car, the concerned 
authorities must come forward to check whether the user is 
using the car beyond the limit. Therefore, there is an 
increasing need to save the environment and nature to live a 
sustainable life. The performance analysis of the car is based 
on the engine type, number of engine cylinders, fuel type, etc.
This study predicts the mpg value by using machine learning 
models like Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), 
XG-Boost, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, etc. and based 
on that it is compared with the optimum value of mpg and 
hence one can reach to a decision to discard the vehicle.

The prime machine learning models used in this work are 
Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, 
XG-Boost, Ridge Regression, Lasso Model, K-Fold. From 
basic to advanced major suitable machine learning 
algorithms are applied, R2 score and root mean square errors 
are calculated via different algorithms and tuning the models 
and hence observing the correctness of predictions.

The dataset for this work has been taken from UCI 
Machine Learning Repository and the primary source of it is 
from the StatLib library, which is maintained at Carnegie 
Mellon University. The dataset was used in the 1983 
American Statistical Association Exposition.
